as3-build-xml
=============

Generic Flex Ant build script for our AS3 friends over here.

It builds the as|mxml at the top level of your src/ folder, using the swc in
your libs/ and put the generated swf files in your bin/ folder. The ASDoc is
generated in the doc/ folder. The Unit Tests are run by your test/TestRunner.as
and the results, including code quality analysis (by FlexPMD, FlexCPD
and FlexMetrics) are put in test-reports/ folder.

It is convention based but you can be configured with a build.properties
and build-config.xml in the root of your project directory.

todo
